	<h3> Food!</h3>
		<dl>
			<dt>Sonic</dt>
				<dd>Sounds really exciting to someone who has never seen one before but is really just fast food.</dd>
			<dt>Red bull and Coffee</dt>
				<dd> <pre>Technically not food.    Seriously you need to eat something other than Red Bull </pre></dd>
			<dt>Fine dining establishments</dt>
				<dd> If you do enough research (or borrow someone else's) it is possible to find non-McDonalds options that are actually pretty decent while you are on the road. </dd>
			<dt>Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives</dt>
				<dd>There is an entire show, website, and plenty of additional research for finding cheap but great food in random locations.</dd>
